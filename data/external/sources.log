Sources of sRNA information:

Arnvig et al, Microbiology Spectrum 2(2):MGM2-00290-2013, 2014
  added start and stop to make largest possible sRNA. Where no terminus
  was known I added information from northern blot data or tuberculist.

DiChiara et al, Nucl Acids Res 38(12):4067-4078, 2010
  the annotation implies larger sRNA than detected experimentally.
  this was done to avoid determining approximate start/end

Miotto et al, PLoS ONE 7(12): e51950, 2012
  added column reflecting the validation by Northern blot.
  1: validated, 0: not tested, -1: false positive

SIPHT (Livny et al, Nucl Acids Res, 34:3484-3493, 2006):
  sRNA Predict2,
  newbio.cs.wisc.edu/sRNA/published_annotations/annotations/NC_000962_sRNA.out_annotated

Tsai et al, PLoS ONE 8(11): e79411, 2013
  kept only information for sRNAs where Msm and BCG probes were shown
  to cross-react with Mtb.

Tuberculist version 2.6 (release 27, March 2013)

Priority given as:
- Arnvig + Tuberculist + Miotto Northern confirmed
  (Non-redundant given that they were curated).
- Miotto A-type
- Non-redundant list of predicted sRNA not included above.

In all cases I used the most inclusive possible coordinates.
